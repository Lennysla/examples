# examples
Example code that I have written. Will be good for future reference. 
hexNumConvert.c - Takes in a hex number and returns a decimal value of the hex. 
replyParser.c - This is a BOOLEAN function. Takes in string arguements and compares one to the other returns true or false if the test string was found in the main string. 
hexNumConvert1.c - Takes in a hex number and returns a decimal value of the hex. Another shorter way to do it.
